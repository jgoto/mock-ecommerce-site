# mock-ecommerce-site
A fictional online store built for demonstration and portfolio purposes. Showcases a simple, clean design and product catalog featuring made-up tech gadgets like Zexa One and Telo Air. This project is not a real business but a practice example for web development skills.

## Developer Statement of Purpose

This project is a fictional e-commerce site, **Wally's Widgets**, created as a demonstration of modern web development skills and best practices.

The site is built using **React** and **Vite** to leverage a fast, modular, and scalable frontend architecture. Hosting is planned on **Vercel** for seamless deployment and efficient serverless performance.

My goal is to develop a feature-complete and user-friendly mock store that simulates real-world e-commerce functionality — including product browsing, filtering, and cart management — while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

I am focusing on scalability and extensibility to ensure the project can easily accommodate new features and future enhancements. This includes modular component design, effective state management, and clear project organization.

This repo serves as a portfolio piece and learning exercise, showcasing my ability to build modern web applications using current tools and workflows.
